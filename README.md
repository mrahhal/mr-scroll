## Packages

We have a [core package](./packages/core) that does the heavy lifting, but you'll probably want to use a framework wrapper from below:

- [Angular](./packages/angular): The wrapper package in Angular.

We also have extra support packages:

- [css-theming](./packages/css-theming): A support package for styling the scrollbar according to the active theme when using [css-theming](https://github.com/mrahhal/css-theming).

Can't find your framework? This means we don't have a wrapper for it yet. Feel free to suggest/contribute one.

## Samples

Samples show you how to use mr-scroll in frameworks.
