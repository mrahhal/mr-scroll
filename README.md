# mr-scroll

The best custom scroll for the web.

## Features

- Custom scrollbar with fully supported styling
- Uses the native browser scrollbar behind the scenes -> smooth scrolling experience, follows the behavior of the browser you're using
- Different modes: normal, overlay, hidden, show on hover, etc
- Emits various events for you to handle (scrolled, top reached, bottom reached, etc)
- Great for implementing infinite paging

## Frameworks

We have the a [core package](./packages/core) that does the heavy lifting, but you'll probably want to use a framework wrapper from below:

- [Angular](./packages/angular)

Can't find your framework? This means we don't have a wrapper for it yet. Feel free to suggest/contribute.

## Samples

Samples show you how to use mr-scroll in frameworks.
