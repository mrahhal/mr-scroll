# mr-scroll

The best custom scroll for the web.

## Features

- Custom scrollbar with full styling
- Uses the native browser scrollbar behind the scenes -> smooth scrolling experience, follows the behavior you're used to
- Different modes: normal, overlay, hidden
- Emits various useful events you can handle (scrolled, state changed, position changed, top reached, bottom reached, etc)
- Great for implementing infinite paging
- Hidden content indicators (shows a gradient to indicate there's hidden content out of view)
- Supports mobile browsers

And finally, we have efficient and idiomatic wrapper packages for popular frameworks (as of now: angular).

## Demo

[TODO]

## Packages

- [Core](./packages/core): The core package. This does the heavy lifting.
- [Angular](./packages/angular): The wrapper package for Angular.

Can't find your framework? This means we don't have a wrapper for it just yet. Feel free to suggest/contribute one.

We also have extra support packages:

- [css-theming](./packages/css-theming): A support package for styling the scrollbar according to the active theme when using [css-theming](https://github.com/mrahhal/css-theming).

## Samples

Samples show you how to use mr-scroll in frameworks.
